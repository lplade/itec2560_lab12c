Astropix with members

Based heavily on [favorite color app.](https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/simple-auth-fav-color-twitter-auth/tree/84f961fd625302511b6931de6283469561fe1038)

This is not quite working.
I think I want to use session support and conditionals instead of serving a special page to signed-in members.

Need to set:
* TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
* TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
